            <h2>Dhanashree Bhor</h2>
            <p>Hello Everyone, I am Dhanashree Bhor, and I am currently pursuing a PG Diploma in Big Data analytics from CDAC Kharghar. I have done my civil engineering in 2018 from Jaihind college of engineering, Junner, Pune with distinction. I have worked in the civil industry in precast structure for 2.5 years but I did not get the career that I wanted in that industry. But during lockdown I developed interest in the IT sector and it has global reach and more flexibility.
                So I want to embrace my career in data analytics to fulfill my personal goals.</p>
